  <h1> The Web  </h1>

  <p>
  The Web is a web proposal project where I was tasked with taking a business concept and creating mock ups for it. The proposal was for a group of comic shops across the country to come together essentially linking their back stock inventories through this website and allowing them to sell to people nearby to keep the costs of shipping down.
