  <h1> Rotten Apple Pinball </h1>

  <p>
   Rotten Apple Pinball is a pinball machine supplier as well as repair service located in Brooklyn, New York. I was tasked with designing a logo for the website. This logo was utilized from 2019-2020. My primary approach to this piece was to take in  the culture of the pinball scene of the 80s that is visible within much of the artwork adorning the machines,  and present that within the branding. The apple was hand drawn using Procreate on an iPad, and the typography was done in Adobe Illustrator.
