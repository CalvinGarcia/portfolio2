  <h1> Description </h1>

  <p>
    A fictional social cause campaign project, Wear A Mask is a reaction to our current state of existence. The core of the project centers around propaganda that anti-maskers are so certain are being used to manipulate the public. To create the feeling of an authoritarian government the Russian Constructivist style was invoked and mixed with the colors of the United States of America. We also wanted to use this overt form of propaganda to show what true authoritarian governments have looked like in the past. These pieces were created using Adobe Illustrator.
