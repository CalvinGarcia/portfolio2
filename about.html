  <p> My name is Calvin Garcia, I am a New York City based graphic designer and illustrator.In the past I have worked as a warehouse manager which has given him a unique perspective on the importance of systems, organization, and keeping up with a fast pace. <br> <br>Graphic design is something that has always intrigued me, and until recently I have had the ability to purusue this path.  While designing I strive for maximum satisfaction of the client, and above all seek to convey a clear cut message in all of his work. I am proficient in Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and Indesign, and do all my work in the Mac/ Apple ecosystem.
